I present to you the free source code of Radinus, a free personal finance management software that I developed in WINDEV.
It allows you to import banking files in CSV, OFX, QIF and CMI format. So you won't have to enter your banking transactions into the software.
You will be able to manage several bank accounts.
It allows you to categorize operations according to various criteria and generate statistics.
Manage your budget.
There is the possibility of dividing transactions into sub-transactions to be more precise in your accounts.
Radinus is a simple software which is intended to evolve in the future, please let me know your comments for future improvements
